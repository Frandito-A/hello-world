# hello-world


Hello folks 

This is the begining of my learning to coding and to computer science as a whole.
Not having any background or expertise whatsoever, I have decided to pursue this path.
yes like anthing in life, there are going to be bumps on the road. However, I pray that I am able to,
through dedication, hardwork, practice, studyin, become a very proficient, effective, skilled software engineering expert.
Technology is ever-changing; therefore, I'll forever keep on learning and improving. 
Today March 3rd 2023 @ 11:00pm, I Just finished watching 
the first video "scratch" from the free Harvard Cs50 course which was very edifying, and informative. I am doing self-studying/self-learning for now.
I am looking forward to seeing my progress along the way because I envision myself working in the tech world as a successful SWE. See it all paid off. 

Everything is possible! 
A toast to a new adventure, as well as a succesful career!
